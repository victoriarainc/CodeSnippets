Using Express and Mongoose, I created an application that organizes code snippets that can be saved for later use.

Snippets have:

a title
a body (the code)
optional notes
a language
tags -- that is, user-defined words or phrases that classify the code, like "authentication", "front-end", "middleware", or "database".

The application includes:

registration and login
the ability to create a snippet
the ability to see a list of all your snippets
the ability to see a list of all your snippets for a specific language
the ability to see a list of all your snippets for a specific tag
allow you to look at an individual snippet
